# ASPECT BASED SENTIMENT ANALYSIS FOR RESTAURANT REVIEW

Have you ever wondered how restaurant owners instantly know what customers love (or hate) about their food and service? Imagine an intelligent system that automatically analyzes restaurant reviews, classifying them as positive, negative, or neutral. Using natural language processing and machine learning, this system provides real-time insights into customer feedback, helping restaurant owners make data-driven decisions and improve their services effortlessly

You would ensure that you have all the Pythons library, you can do that by running:
pip install nltk scikit-learn numpy,
xml.etree.ElementTree,
nltk.tokenize,
sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer,
sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression,

Now that you have all the necessary libraries, you would want to use your data of choice for the sentiment analysis. Then you create a function to pass the XML data,

Then preprocess the training data. Go ahead to create a function to predict polarity for a new review with a confidence threshold. you could also create a function to get the emoji and color based on polarity. finally, the tip of the iceberg is where you showcase a GUI creation. This depicts the label for the input field, Creates a text box for inputting reviews, Creates a button to predict the polarity, and Creates a label to display the predicted polarity and emoji.

Iâ€™m excited to rework this project, uncover more insights, and find better ways to represent the data. I love taking on challenges. Have fun!
